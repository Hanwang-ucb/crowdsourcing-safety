I don’t feel safe riding a bicycle on any of the streets and highways in Sonoma County.  There are multiple reasons why they are unsafe.  

1.  Vegetation over hanging in the bike paths, forcing cyclists into the roadway.

2.  Debris in the bike paths, i.e., gravel, branches, broken glass, rocks, mud, nails, etc, forcing cyclists into the roadway or having to change a flat tire, as a result of a puncture from the debris.

3.  Pot holes on streets, highways and bicycle paths, forcing the cyclists to maneuver around the obstacles and on coming vehicles.

4. The electrical sensors that trigger the traffic lights to turn green are not sensitive enough to pick up a bicycle, forcing the cyclist to make turns illegally or get off the bike and walk across the pedestrian walkway.

Many of these problems could be significantly reduced with monthly highway and street (i.e., Including the shoulders and bike paths) sweeping and vegetation clearance.
